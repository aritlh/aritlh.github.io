The following is a vulnhub engine search from 2004. While this website may not be completely safe from advanced attacks, it serves as a valuable learning resource for beginners like me to practice identifying and exploiting common and easy-to-find web application vulnerabilities.

Boot the machine, then perform host scanning using `netdiscover`.

```shell
$ sudo netdiscover
```

After obtaining the target IP, perform port scanning using `nmap`.

```shell
$ sudo nmap -sSC -Pn <IP>
```

- `nmap`: Calls the Nmap program.
- `-sS`: Performs a TCP SYNC scan, which is a fast and efficient type of port scan.
- `-C`: Enables Nmap's default script to get more information about the target.
- `-Pn`: Ignores host discovery and continues scanning on the given target, regardless of whether the target responds or not.
- `<IP>`: The IP address of the target to be scanned

So, this command will perform a TCP SYN port scan on `<IP>` display the version of Nmap in use, enable Nmap default scripts to gather additional information about the target, and will continue the scan without verifying whether the target is responding or not.
