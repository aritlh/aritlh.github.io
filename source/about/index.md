## 关于我自己
I'm a proper coding fanatic, mate. Can't get enough of that programming malarkey. One thing that really gets me going is ethical hacking - finding security holes and plugging them up before any dodgy blokes try to exploit the system, y'know? but i still newbie forever.

As for coding languages, JavaScript and TypeScript are right up my street. JS is the main lingo for web development, and TypeScript builds on it with some fancy object-oriented stuff and static type checking. Smashing, that is.

I've also got a bit of Python under my belt, even though I'm not an expert or anything. Dead handy language for data analysis, web apps, AI, you name it.

And then there's Rust - a systems programming language that's bloody brilliant when it comes to security and performance. Ideal for operating systems, device drivers, low-level system apps and the like.
I'm well chuffed to keep learning and trying out new tech. Coding's my passion, innit? Hopefully, I can make a decent contribution to the programming world and keep the cyber security lot on their toes.
